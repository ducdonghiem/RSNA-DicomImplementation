use this python env:
/home/student/dod2/Documents/URA25/LLM_Quantization/Task1-Llama7b_extract/myenv/bin/python

if u use myenv and have all the required libs installed (where python returns the correct path) but still see cannot be resolved error, 
it is because of the IDE is still using the wrong python. Change the python interpreter and here u go.
