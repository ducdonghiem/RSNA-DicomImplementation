use this python env:
/home/student/dod2/Documents/URA25/LLM_Quantization/Task1-Llama7b_extract/myenv/bin/python

source ../../LLM_Quantization/Task1-Llama7b_extract/myenv/bin/activate.csh

if u use myenv and have all the required libs installed (where python returns the correct path) but still see cannot be resolved error, 
it is because of the IDE is still using the wrong python. Change the python interpreter and here u go.

# to check github acc
git config --global user.email 


# for gallium server, to fix "file too large" error while downloading libs:
bash                        # switch to bash
ulimit -a | grep file       # check quota
ulimit -f unlimited         # this is the command
pip install torch==1.13.1 --target=/â€¦  # install
